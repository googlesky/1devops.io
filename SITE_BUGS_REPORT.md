# Site Bug Report and Fixes

## Summary
I've conducted a comprehensive review of the entire Jekyll site and identified several critical bugs and issues that have been fixed.

## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Layout Files
**Issue**: The `_config.yml` file references layout templates that don't exist:
- Line 48: `layout: "vulnerability"`  
- Line 53: `layout: "tool"`

**Impact**: Any content using these layouts would fail to render properly.

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Created missing layout files

### 2. Footer Configuration Bugs
**Issue**: The footer template references undefined configuration variables:
- `site.contact.address` (not defined in config, should be `site.contact.location`)
- `site.social.twitter` (not defined in config)

**Impact**: Footer would show blank/undefined values for these fields.

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Updated configuration and footer template

### 3. Empty Favicon File
**Issue**: The favicon.ico file is empty (0.0B size)

**Impact**: Browser won't display a favicon, affecting branding and user experience.

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Generated proper favicon

### 4. Non-functional Contact Form
**Issue**: Contact form has `action="#"` which means submissions go nowhere

**Impact**: Users can't actually send messages through the contact form.

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Updated form to use proper submission handling

### 5. CSS/Styling Issues
**Issue**: Some CSS classes and styles may not be properly defined

**Impact**: Visual inconsistencies and potential layout problems.

**Status**: ✅ REVIEWED - CSS structure is generally good, minor improvements made

## Technical Improvements Made
